## About
This repo is to record exercise and question solutions in the book: `Functional programming in Scala`.
To get something more interesting, I use `Scala3` to finish the repo.

The whole repo structure shall follow the [original repo](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala) for the book with Scala2.
