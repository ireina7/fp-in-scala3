# Functional Programming in Scala3
Functional Programming in Scala book study in `Scala3`

## About
This repo is to 
1. record exercise and question solutions in the book: `Functional programming in Scala`;
2. record experiments using library `cats`;  
3. record experiments of my new ideas on function programming in `Scala3`.

To get things more interesting, I use `Scala3` to finish the repo.
